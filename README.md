# Trilogy-Group-Project-2 - Space your Problems (working title)

Running the server locally requires a .env file with the following information:
SECRET='a secret'
DB_USER='root'
DB_PW='password'
DB_NAME='space_problems_db'

Where DB_ variables are your local SQL credentials and an existing database. Secret can be anything, more important for when the page is live.

## Temporary Home for Project Aims

The below will be rewritten and migrate to a more appropriate home shortly.

'Space your problems' aims to be a mental health anti-social social media web app.

A general idea of the project can be surmised by the user story:
- As a user I can:
  - Make a post about a problem, feeling etc. in confidence
  - I can see how many other users have indicated that they also experience the contents of my posts
  - View posts from other users and indicate whether I experience the contents of a post
  - Hide and/or Delete posts I have made
  - Close my account and by extension hide/delete my posts
- As a moderator I can:
  - View all posts currently flagged as reported
  - Hide and/or delete posts
  - Flag a user as having broken ToS previously
  - Ban a user account upon too many ToS violations

The idea behind space your problems is not to replace therapy or other professional assistance services, in fact the web app should promote utilizing these services to help with problems, promotion of suicide prevention hotlines would also likely be sensible for a web app like this. The space the app is envisioned to occupy is one of a sort of catharsis tool, a user may vent/be vulernable in a safe environment and have the opportunity to feel validated as well.
